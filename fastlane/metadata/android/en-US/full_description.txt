This application offers the following features :

- Opening all files without a corresponding Android application.
- Display of the file in hexadecimal (or plain text) with the possibility to modify the content (in hexadecimal only).
- Saving the file on the smartphone/tablet.
- Search option in the open file (hexadecimal and plain text modes).

Caution: Opening files that are too large seriously degrades application performance and can suddenly stop the application on low-resource devices.
