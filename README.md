(GPL) Android Hex Viewer is a FREE software.

This software is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY.

This application offers the following features :
* Opening all files without a corresponding Android application.
* Display of the file in hexadecimal (or plain text) with the possibility to modify the content (in hexadecimal only).
* Saving the file on the smartphone/tablet.
* Search option in the open file (hexadecimal and plain text modes).

Caution: Opening files that are too large seriously degrades application performance and can suddenly stop the application on low-resource devices.

 	Use with android studio
