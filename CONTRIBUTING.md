# How To Contribute

## Bug fixes

You can simply report a problem via an issue, or even provide pull requests with fixes for a bug you discovered.

About the style of the code: Try to respect the original style as much as possible.


## Translations

[![Weblate](https://weblate.bubu1.eu/widgets/hexviewer/-/multi-auto.svg)][weblate]

You are invited to provide translations for the app. But there are some rules.

* Please translate only if you're **familiar with the nomenclature of the Android system**. If you're not sure, check the official documentation and see how it should be done.
* Contribute only if you commit to translating the **majority** of the strings. No one wants an application that is a mix of English and native language. I may remove translations, if they are not updated on new string resources.

Translations can be provided via [Weblates][weblate].
